    h2.fhr Faster Hit Recovery
    p. 
      Faster Hit Recovery, also known as FHR, is a stat that controls your characters ability to recover after being hit by a mobs attack that deals more than 1/12 of your current HP.
      This means if you have 120HP and get hit for 10+ damage, your character will enter into "Hit-Stun," thus preventing you from completing any actions until you exit. This Hit-Stun can
      last anywhere from 0-17 frames(per hit) and can be reduced by acquiring gear that has the Faster Hit Recovery on it. Each class requires a different amount of Faster Hit Recovery in order to
      have these frames reduced. The chart below will show each class, along with how much FHR is needed to reduce Hit-Stun:

    h2 Faster Cast Rate
    p.
      Faster Cast Rate, also known as FCR, is a stat that controls how many frames it takes to cast any given spell. All spells have the same frame data (minus the sorceress) for any given class.
      This means that no matter which spell you are casting, the frames to cast those spells will all be the same. The more Faster Cast Rate you have, the faster your spell will be caster, thus
      allowing you to complete other actions. The chart below will show each class, along with how much FCR is needed to reduce casting frames:
